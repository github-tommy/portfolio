                    The name "Bellevue" is derived from the French words for "beautiful view". Bellevue is a city in the Eastside region of King County, Washington, United States, across Lake Washington from Seattle. Prior to 2008, downtown Bellevue underwent rapid change, with many high rise projects under construction, and was relatively unaffected by the economic downturn. The downtown area is currently the second largest city center in Washington state with 1,300 businesses, 45,000 employees and 10,200 residents.
